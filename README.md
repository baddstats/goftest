# goftest

This repository contains the sources for the
contributed `R` package `goftest`, which performs
goodness-of-fit tests.

The package implements the classical Cramer-von Mises
and Anderson-Darling tests of goodness-of-fit
for continuous univariate distributions, using modern
algorithms to compute the null distributions.

The package was written by Adrian Baddeley, Julian Faraway,
John Marsaglia and George Marsaglia.

This package is free open source under the GNU Public Licence GPL 2|3.
